# Side scroller Defold Demo

[Play the game](https://bryukh.github.io/Defold-Side-Scroller/)

This game is based on the [Side scroller tutorial](https://defold.com/learn/tutorials/side-scroller/).
I've changed the visuals to fantasy style and added some new features.

The game you will work with is extremely simple. The player controls a dragon and is supposed to collect food and dodge crowsthat appear on the screen.
The dragon is controlled with the up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.

TODO add link to the game

Happy Defolding!
